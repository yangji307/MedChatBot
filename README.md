### assignment 1
1. the first difference is the input type:McCulloch-Pitts Neuron accpets only binary inputs. Perceptron: Supports both binary and real-valued inputs. the second difference is that perceptron is trainable, while McCulloch-Pitts Neuron is not. the last difference is that McCulloch-Pitts Neuron can only handle logical tasks such as AND, OR, while Perceptron is designed to tackle binary classification.
